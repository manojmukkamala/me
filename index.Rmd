### Play Ground
I have created the following data visualizations in Jupyter Notebook and created beautiful reports out of it by following the steps in Project GiJu. These are still Work In Progress.

- __[DataVisualization](pythonreports/DataVisualization.html)__ page has the exercises from Kaggle's __[Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/hello-seaborn)__ course.

- __[DataVisualizationfromNon-CoderToCoder](pythonreports/DataVisualizationfromNon-CoderToCoder.html)__ page has the exercises from Kaggle's another __[Data Visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/residentmario/welcome-to-data-visualization)__ course.

### Podcasts

<img src="pod.png" width=300 height=200 align=right>

- I listen to Podcasts while working out and I found this guy named AJ Hoge who runs the [Effortless English Club](https://effortlessenglishclub.com/). His podcasts are really cool and I particularly liked his [Movie Technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=791cOfTEkEc). 

- Movie Technique is a method to improve English Speaking using a Movie. 

__Personality Development:__ 

- Also, I love the podcasts from [Farnam Street](https://fs.blog/the-knowledge-project/). They are very informative.

__Technology:__

- Recently, I started listening to the Towards Data Science and Artificial Intelligence by Lex Fridman and I personally recommend [the Episode with Andrew Ng](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jspaMLxBig&list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4)

<br><br>

### TED Talks

- I feel TED talks are like Gatorades for Motivation. Provides Instant Relief from Depression.

- I have a list of TED talks that are my favourites but this TED talk by Stephen Duneier is very inspiring and worth watching
